          <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>
          <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
          <b>I will be covering the following points from my research of
            neuroplasticity:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>- How understanding the principles benefit people?</li>
            <li>- How I will engage with it for my benefit?</li>
            <li>- Ways to increase neuroplasticity?</li>
            <li>- Link to resource/reference I found useful or engaging</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Neuroplasticity creates an adaptive, memory forming mindset that
            will help you form new neural connections. It has many benefits
            other than learning, it can help treat mental injury and treat
            neurological disorders. Being able to understand how it works and
            training/practicing will help you overcome many challenges
            throughout your learning experience, no matter what you set your
            mind to. It helps strengthen and enhance exisitng skills and
            cognitive abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me its helped me with procrastination and made me look at the
            way I learn in a different way. As I learn new things regarding
            coding, to retain the knowledge and give myself the ability to
            learn more increasing my neuroplasticity wil lgive me a foot up in
            this indevour.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few ways to increase neuroplasticity is to be constantly
            learning new skills, but challenging yourself as you do this.
            Managing your stress levels and sleep are also ways that can help
            (not the easiest and are quite subjective) sleeping gives your
            brain a safe time rest and reflect on what you have learnt, and
            staying in a constant state of stress can but your body in a
            subconscious flight or fight response which will effect your
            ability to retain knowledge as you are stuck in the “now”.

          <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
          <b>I will be covering the following points from my research of
            a Growth Mindset:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>- What is it and why is it relevant?</li>
            <li>- In my research did anything surprise or change for me?</li>
            <li>- How will I integrate into my own learning journey?</li>
            <li>- Link to resource/reference I found useful or engaging</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A growth mindset can be summarised in two words, "not yet" not achiving something and giving up is a closed
            mindset,
            or just achiving and being happy with the bare minimum is also closed, but the phrase not yet, targets
            giving something
            a go again and again untill you get it, or striving for personal excelence. A growth mindset embraces
            challenge, it looks
            at putting in the effort to excel in what you do and learning from what went wrong to exceed you last
            effort. It is
            relevant because it creates great resilience and creates habits in success.</p>
          <p>The concept of a growth mindset is not new to me, as part of my own personally journey I have learned to
            adapt it into my own lifestyle.
            Researching it this past week hasn't had any moment that's really stood out for me but learning different
            reasons on why it is
            important have helped me grow my own understanding even more.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned before, I have already adopted the growth mindset in my study and learning journey, but for
            me my challenge is always
            staying on top of everything and not being ashamed to ask for help.</p>

          <h2>How it Blends into my learning plan and strategies</h2>
          <p>The way these both blend into my learning plan is by continusely learning and engaging in the challenges I
            face throughout my study.
            The more I learn and challenge myself with the more my neuropalsticity will improve, and by accepting all
            and any challenges I come across I will be sticking to the growth mindset.</p>
