          <h1>My Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
          <h2>Evidence</h2>
          <p>
            Using the tools provided by the student handbook around the
            personality test these are some of the results.

          <b>DOPE test:</b>
          <p>
            “Logical, mathematically minded, methodical and sometimes seen as a
            perfectionist. They can be slow to make decisions and inflexible if
            rules and logic say otherwise. They are not big risk takers but love
            detail..”
          </p>
          <b>Strength finder:</b>
          <p>This came back saying I value Honesty</p>

          <h2>Documentation</h2>
          <p>Regarding the first test, I'm not actually sure how to read that information so I can't use it as a reliable reference, but I have included it. 
            The DOPE test had some things correct, I do prefer logic over feelings, although not being inconsiderate to how others feel, 
            this is more as a reflection for myself. the third test came back with honesty as my top value and I would have to agree, 
            honesty regardless the impact for me is important.</p>
          <h2>My Ethical Decision.</h2>
          <p>I find this hard to find something to share that doesn't get too personal, I have a few examples I could use but I wouldn't feel comfortable sharing them. 
            An example I could give vaguely, I had quite an addiction to something and so did a good friend of mine, we kept enabling eachother and for the good of myself 
            and him I distanced myself to clean up my act, as we had both tried before but just enabled eachother again. And due to that both of us have cleane dup our act, 
            although for our own good do not have much contact.</p>
          <h2>How my Culture and people influenced my values.</h2>
          <p>My culture could be described in many ways. I was born in South Africa but moved young, a culture I align to is the metal culture. 
            People are there to enjoy and have fun but if someone falls, they help them to their feet faster than they could hit the ground. 
            A lot of my values will come from my parents, although we have differences in views we can still respect each other as trivial things 
            shouldn't define your views on people.</p>
          <h2>My Strengths</h2>
          <p>Some of my strengths are logic, honesty and determination once I have my mind set to something. 
            Logic will allow me to assess different challenges, Determination will help me tackle those challenges and Honesty will help me be honest when 
            I'm stuck and letting myself ask for help.</p>
          <h2>Limitations</h2>
          <p>My limitations will be the fault mentioned before^^. I am determined when I set my mind on a task, I have to work hard to keep that task related 
            to my study and learning. My ability to ask for help is something that could limit me but I need to make sure to ask every and all questions I have. 
            I definitly can struggle to do a task if I do not understand the importance nof it.</p>
          <h2>Team Work Example</h2>
          <p>An example is when we implemented the scrum/agile method into our company, when trying to get it all started the first couple sprints we fell short as 
            we had to adjust, we also had lots of bad habits as a team we had to break but did. once we got the work flow sorted we started getting a lot more done. </p></br>
