          <h1>Problem Solving Methods With Javascript</h1>
          <b>I am going to discuss my experience with problem solving my JS issue I came across.</b></br></br>

            <h2 id="rgbText">A simple problem I got blocked on: </h2>
          </button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>I got stuck on taking a String of words (a sentence) and converting every first letter of the word to a
              capital letter.</p>
            <p>To solve this problem I have to do a lot of research into understanding how .map() works, I also had to
              learn how .split() , and .toUpperCase() works. I watched youtube videos on how the different parts worked.
              I also used the testing method that was provided into the code that gave me checks to see if I had passed
              the check.</p>
            <p>Throughout this process of figuring it out I felt quite frustrated but once it all clicked I started
              feeling more confident in my ability to even learn JS.</p>
            <p>In this problem I learnt how to write a capitalizing function. But also learnt a few different built in
              methods of JS</p>
            <img src="../images/techImages/capitalize function js.png" style="width: 80%;">
            <p>This would output something like this:</p>
            <p><span class="codeExample">This Is A String Of Words</span></p>
          </div>
          <button type="button" class="collapsible">
            <h2 id="rgbText">How I solved a problem elegantly: </h2>
          </button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>The problem I had was due to me not understnading what the code was doing but using the built in test
              function on the question wasnt helping me. I couldn't tell what was being output or what data was being
              passed into the parameters.</p>
            <p>The way I overcame this was I pulled the code into a blank index.js and index.html file, created my data
              that I could pass through, and logged that data into my own console terminal. This way I could play around
              with each question again and again untill I had it working exactly how I wanted it to, then I copied my
              now completed code back into the testing sheet.</p>
            <p>I felt pretty happy figuring out I could do this, and I have done it for all problems I get stuck on
              since, a local “playground” to test all functions (and save ones I like)</p>
            <p>I learnt how to properly use the console logs to my benefit and how to read error messages</p>
