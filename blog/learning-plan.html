          <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
          <h2>What is my long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
          <p>My long-term goal that I hope to achieve from this course is to be able to program my own game. 
            My shorter-term goal is to become a useful developer at my current job and grow my skills.</p>
          <h2>
            What are my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?
          </h2>
          <b>My strengths when it comes to learning:</b>
          <p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
              <li>When focused I am very committed to finishing a task,</li>
              <li>I can work well in a team environment (even though I am quite introverted)</li>
              <li>I'm experimental, I like to try things and see if it works, if it doesn't then I'll try something else</li>
            </ul>

          </p>
          <b>My limitations (weaknesses) when it comes to learning:</b>
          <p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
              <li>I can become easily distracted if I'm not in the right environment, I can become sidetracked on focusing on small insignificant 
                details that then lead me to taking longer than needed on a certain part of a task.</li>
              <li>I struggle to ask for help so I end up falling behind, ( I am working on being better at this)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h2>
            What human skills would I like to develop in yourself while at Dev
            Academy?
          </h2>
          <p>Self motivation, I'm not to sure what else, I know I could add a few things, but I am quite comfortable and confident with who I am and 
            what I like and am willing to put myself out into. Getting motivated to do stuff and stop procrastinating is my biggest thing to work on. 
            Also socialising a bit more could help, I tend to be quite introverted which works for me, but being a bit more out there will be good.</p>
          <h2>
            A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.
          </h2>
          <p>To keep myself on track and productive I will be making use of my own set time boxes, this way I can allow myself to have small breaks without 
            letting myself get too off task. Working with others I will respect how everyone else learns and works, that way when in teamwork we can work productively 
            using each other's strengths and weaknesses to find a perfect balance. When everything is getting too stressful for me, I will most likely go for a walk in 
            nature as that's my anchor point for everything. If its due to being stuck I will get help from facilitators when available or other class mates if they can help. 
            I will first try to figure it out myself.</p></br>
          <h2>what I expect from the Facilitation team?</h2>
          <p>I expect help when its required, not handholding but guidance through my challenges I come up to. I expect them to be understanding that if I don't understand 
            what they are asking of me I might need it explained in a slightly different way.</p>
          <h2>My Schedule</h2>
          <p>I am working full time, but due to the nature and flexibility of my job I can work and study interchangeably. 
            Meaning if I'm required earlier in the day for whatever reason I will be able to set time for course then. I do have a 10 month old boy, and for me 
            spending time with him is extremely important so early evenings I can be unavailable if my partner is not around, my partner also travels for work 
            so when she does I will be unavailable due to prioritizing looking after my boy, Until he's in bed then I'm free again.</p></br>
