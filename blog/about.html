          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <b>A brief introduction into who i am and what im about:</b>
          <p>My name is Ezra, and i am a currently working doing test analysis, data entry and customer support for a
            company called Vice Versa.</br>
            I am also studying part time at Dev Academy so I can grow my skills and become a full time Developer.</p>
          <p>My partner and our boy are my driving force and are the most important things in my life. as of writing
            this he is a couple months off being 1yrs old!</p>
          <b>My Hobbies</b>
          <p>i enjoy lots of different things. Music is a very important thing to me, playing and listening. Being out
            in nature centers me and i also love ruding my motorbike.</p>
          <p>My goals during my study are to eventually become a game dev, but this is more as a side project for
            personal enjoyment.</p>
