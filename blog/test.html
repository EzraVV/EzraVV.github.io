          <b>.section
splits up the page horizontally. You'll need a few of these to break up the content, and you can use them in your main wrapper, or within other divs.

.col
divides the section into columns. Each column has a left margin of 1.6% (around 20 pixels on a normal monitor), except the first one. Using .col:first-child { margin-left: 0; } means you don't need to use class="last" anywhere. It works in all browsers since IE6.

.group
solves floating problems, by forcing the section to self clear its children (aka the clearfix hack). This is good in Firefox 3.5+, Safari 4+, Chrome, Opera 9+ and IE 6+.

.span_1_of_3
specifies the width of the column. Using percentages means it's 100% fluid.

@media queries
as soon as the screen size gets less than 480 pixels the columns stack and the margins disappear.</b>

            What human skills would I like to develop in yourself while at Dev
            Academy?
          </h2>
          <p>Self motivation, I'm not to sure what else, I know I could add a few things, but I am quite comfortable and confident with who I am and 
            what I like and am willing to put myself out into. Getting motivated to do stuff and stop procrastinating is my biggest thing to work on. 
            Also socialising a bit more could help, I tend to be quite introverted which works for me, but being a bit more out there will be good.</p>
          <h2>
            A commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.
          </h2>
          <p>To keep myself on track and productive I will be making use of my own set time boxes, this way I can allow myself to have small breaks without 
            letting myself get too off task. Working with others I will respect how everyone else learns and works, that way when in teamwork we can work productively 
            using each other's strengths and weaknesses to find a perfect balance. When everything is getting too stressful for me, I will most likely go for a walk in 
            nature as that's my anchor point for everything. If its due to being stuck I will get help from facilitators when available or other class mates if they can help. 
            I will first try to figure it out myself.</p></br>
          <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
          <h2>What is my long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
          <p>My long-term goal that I hope to achieve from this course is to be able to program my own game. 
            My shorter-term goal is to become a useful developer at my current job and grow my skills.</p>
          <h2>
            What are my strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?

          <b>My strengths when it comes to learning:</b>
          <p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
              <li>When focused I am very committed to finishing a task,</li>
              <li>I can work well in a team environment (even though I am quite introverted)</li>
              <li>I'm experimental, I like to try things and see if it works, if it doesn't then I'll try something else</li>
            </ul>

          </p>
          <b>My limitations (weaknesses) when it comes to learning:</b>
          <p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
              <li>I can become easily distracted if I'm not in the right environment, I can become sidetracked on focusing on small insignificant 
                details that then lead me to taking longer than needed on a certain part of a task.</li>
              <li>I struggle to ask for help so I end up falling behind, ( I am working on being better at this)</li>
