            <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
            <b>
              In this blog entry i will explore my understanding of emotional
              inteligence.
            </b></br>
            <h2>What is Emotional Intelegence?</h2>
            <p>
              Emotional intelegence is the ability to understand and disect your
              emotions rather than just being ruled by them, an example could be
              not just feeling sad but identfying why your sad and acknowledging
              it. Emotional intelgence allows you to understand your emotions
              and how they effect you and or others.
            </p></br>
            <h2>How is EQ different from IQ?</h2>
            <p>
              IQ relates to your problem solving, and logical thinking, it is your knowlegde of the world, 
              where as EQ is your ability to understand and detect emotions be that in you or others, 
              its your ability to understand and acknowledge those feelings and their causes. 
              (IQ and EQ are more indepth than that but at a surface level that is the difference)
            </p></br>
            <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
            <p>
              EQ is important because it allows you to understand those around you better and yourself better, 
              it helps you in almost all social situations. If you do not have a good emotional intelegence you can lack the 
              ability to work with others in a constuctive way.</br> EQ helps us relate to others and preceive their emotions and our own.
