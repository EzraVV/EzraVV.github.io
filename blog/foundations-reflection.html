          <h1>Fondations Reflection</h1>
          <b>• What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills
            learning?</b>
          <p>I have noticed that I am gaining confidence in my self I know this relates to the tech side of things but I
            definitly am becoming more confident. I also have noticed ive slowly found it a bit easier to ask for help
            which is something I do still struggle with a lot. The third thing I have learnt about myself is my
            interaction with other class mates, as I tend to just keep to myself but have found mysdelf discussing the
            current sprint work with my peers.</p></br>
          <b>• What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</b>
          <p>When working in a team environment (mostly the case for programming) you are going to have to be
            understanding and self aware for others you are working with.</p></br>
          <b>• What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</b>
          <p>Honestly not to much, I had an idea of wha tit was, some of the methods we have learnt to manage time I
            guess have helped me.</p></br>
          <b>• What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?</b>
          <p>Probably the interactiing with others, I very much like ot keep to myself, so having to be a bit more out
            there and interact with people who arent in my dailly circle is a bit of a challenge.</p></br>
          <b>• Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in
            a web development Bootcamp course?</b>
          <p>As it has been mentioned, to an employer, all the skill in the world wont help you if you cannot work with
            other people. It helps manage the stresses of working in a team, but also helps you work as a functioning
            member of a team.</p></br>
          <b>• Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have
            just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</b>
          <p>Yes and no, in my schooling when is was younger I was taught the benefits of human skills, I feel like my
            focus should be and will be programming, because it's the thing that is new to me, and I need more time
            learning to code, then I do learning to function around other people. This doesn't discredit the value of
            human skills, but my priorities are with the part of study I am not familiar with.</p></br>
